Your full Spaciable access has now expired but that doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy its benefits!

You will still be able to use your login details to access the portal and access many of the useful features; however, you will notice the developer branding revert to Spaciable branding.

You’ll also no longer receive notifications from your developer or be able to upload your own documents.

However, you can renew your access on an annual basis for just £<%=@payment_charge%>, which will provide you with continued access to these features.

If you want to use Spaciable to continue to make the most of your home, receive the latest site news and maintain key information for a future home sale, you can renew your access using this secure link below:

<%=@payment_link%>

We hope you’ve enjoyed using Spaciable and continue to do so.

Kind regards,

The Spaciable Team
