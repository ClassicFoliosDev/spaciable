  question: %(There is a white powder on my walls. Is this a defect?),
  answer: %(<p>No. You may notice a white, chalk-like substance on the exterior brickwork of your new home.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a defect, just the natural salts escaping from the building materials.&nbsp; Efflorescence will be washed away naturally by rainfall and will stop once the salts are exhausted.&nbsp;</p>

  question: %(Why are there small cracks in my walls and ceilings?),
  answer: %(<p>The materials that were used to build your new home contained a lot of water. This water will take around 6–18 months to evaporate completely, which is known as the drying out process. During this time, the plasterwork in your home may shrink slightly, causing some small changes to occur. One of these changes is small cracks appearing in plastered finishes, which can be filled using a suitable product and covered with paint.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the other common signs of drying out and simple steps you can take to deal with them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Baths and shower trays may drop very slightly. You should reseal them around the edges with a silicone sealant</li>
	<li>Wooden door frames and windows may move. Simply adjust the door or window keep if necessary</li>
	<li>Nail or screw heads may pop out of plastered finishes. Hammer or screw them down, fill the hole with a suitable product and cover with paint</li>
</ul>

  question: %(How can I reduce condensation in my home?),
  answer: %(<p>Condensation is steam or water vapour, which reverts to water on contact with a cold surface. There are a few steps you can take to reduce condensation in your home:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stop moisture from spreading by closing kitchen and bathroom doors when cooking, showering or bathing</li>
	<li>Cover pans when cooking</li>
	<li>Use extractor fans and ventilation systems</li>
	<li>Open windows when possible and leave trickle vents open at all times (where fitted). Or, if you have a whole house ventilation system, leave windows and trickle vents closed, and keep your system running constantly</li>
	<li>Leave internal and wardrobe doors (except fire doors) open when possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite taking these steps, condensation may still occur. Simply wipe the affected surface with a dry cloth to prevent moisture from soaking into finishes.

  answer: %(<p>A miniature circuit breaker (MCB) on your consumer unit usually trips either because a light bulb has blown or a faulty appliance has overloaded the circuit or caused a short circuit somewhere in the system.&nbsp; Instead of just switching the MCB back on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to your consumer unit and identify which circuit has been affected; the relevant MCB will be in the &lsquo;off&rsquo; position</li>
	<li>Disconnect (rather than just switch off) any appliances on this circuit</li>
	<li>Switch the MCB back on to restore the circuit</li>
	<li>Reconnect the appliances in turn and see if the MCB fuses again.&nbsp; If it does, this will show which is the faulty appliance</li>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t find the fault, please call an electrician.</p>

<p>It is important to note that some faults are intermittent and everything may work for a short time.&nbsp; In this case, don&rsquo;t keep switching the MCB and instead call a suitably qualified electrician to correct the fault.</p>
